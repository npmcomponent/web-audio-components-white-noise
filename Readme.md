# White Noise

  A simple white noise generator module for the Web Audio API.

## Installation

    $ component install web-audio-components/white-noise

## Example Usage

```javascript
var context = new (AudioContext ||webkitAudioContext)()
  , Noise = require("white-noise")
  , noise = new Noise(context, {
      channels: 2,
      bufferSize: 4096,
      stereo: true
    });

noise.connect(context.destination);
noise.start(0);
```

For further examples, see the example.

## API

### WhiteNoise(context, options)

Instantiate a white-noise effect module. Expects an `AudioContext` as the first
parameter.

**Options**

- `channels` Number of channels (default: `2`)
- `stereo` Boolean of whether or not each channel should be unique (default: `true`)
- `bufferSize` Size of the generated buffer (128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192, 16384 are the only allowed values) (default: `4096`)

### .connect(node)

Connect a WhiteNoise module to an `AudioNode`.

### .disconnect()

Disconnect all outgoing connections from a WhiteNoise module.

### .start(when, [offset, duration])

Starts emitting audio; recreates the buffer and proxies the [buffer source node's `start` method](http://www.w3.org/TR/webaudio/#AudioBufferSourceNode-section).

### .stop(when)
Schedules a sound to stop playback at an exact time; proxies the [buffer source node's `stop` method](http://www.w3.org/TR/webaudio/#AudioBufferSourceNode-section).
